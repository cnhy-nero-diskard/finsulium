# Timeline Chart & Currency Features

## 📊 Timeline Chart

The Timeline Chart is a powerful, configurable visualization tool on your dashboard that helps you understand your financial patterns over time.

### Chart Configuration Options

#### **1. Time Period** (When to look)
Choose the time window for your data:

- **7 Days**: Quick overview of recent activity
- **30 Days**: Standard monthly view
- **90 Days**: Quarterly trends and patterns
- **1 Year**: Annual comparison and yearly trends
- **All Time**: Complete historical view of all transactions

#### **2. Group By** (How to aggregate)
Control how data is summarized:

- **Daily**: Day-by-day breakdown (best for 7-30 day periods)
- **Weekly**: Week-by-week aggregation (good for 30-90 day periods)
- **Monthly**: Month-by-month view (ideal for 90 day+ periods)

**Tip**: For 7 days, use "Daily". For 1 year+, use "Monthly" to reduce clutter.

#### **3. View Mode** (What to display)

**Income vs Expenses**
